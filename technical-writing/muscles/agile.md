# Agile development vs Waterfall

## Head (data and logic)
- Agile alliance
- Agile development delivers small amounts of value iteratively
- Waterfall delivers all the value at the end
  > PROBLEM: What if the project is canceled half way through?
- Agile is now more common than waterfall(?)
- Scrum is probably the most common type of agile
- XP practices
  - Energized work
  - Information workspace
  - Whole team
  - Sit together
  - Stories
  - Weekly cycle
  - Quarterly cycle
  - Slack
  - Pair programming
  - Test first programming
  - Incremental design
  - Continuous integration
  - 10 minute build

## Heart (emotion)
- Stress during waterfall release
  > PROBLEM: Large infrequent release are stressful
- Lower stress during agile release
- Agile practices for lowering chance of burnout
  > PROBLEM: Long waterfall projects can lead to emotional and intellectual burn out
- Customer feels more involved in agile
  > PROBLEM: Customers on waterfall projects feel more remote, and require regular status updates

## "You" (character)
- Customer has to be committed and involved daily/weekly in agile
  > PROBLEM: If a customer does not commit to an agile project, the project is likely to fail
- People have to be able to cope with change in agile
  > PROBLEM: Requirements can change frequently in an agile project. That can be chaotic when you first experience it.
- Agile team members are accountable daily
  > PROBLEM: Some people do not like to render an account of everything they work on
- Some practices (e.g. test first programming) require discipline
  > PROBLEM: Some people *hate* pair programming
  > PROBLEM: Test driven development requires a lot of discipline
  > PROBLEM: User stories are harder to write than features
  > PROBLEM: Managers might want to avoid agile "slack"
  > PROBLEM: Hard to get a build/test CI running in under 10 minutes
  > PROBLEM: Some designers prefer an "up front" design
